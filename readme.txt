Lets you embed MS Office, PDF, and many other file types in a web page using the Google Docs Viewer (no Flash or PDF browser plug-ins required).

== Description ==

Google Doc Embedder lets you embed several types of files into your WordPress pages using the Google Docs Viewer - allowing inline viewing (and optional downloading) of the following file types, with no Flash or PDF browser plug-ins required:

* Adobe Acrobat (PDF)
* Microsoft Word (DOC/DOCX*)
* Microsoft PowerPoint (PPT/PPTX*)
* Microsoft Excel (XLS/XLSX*)
* TIFF Images (TIF, TIFF)
* Apple Pages (PAGES)
* Adobe Illustrator (AI)
* Adobe Photoshop (PSD)
* Autodesk AutoCad (DXF)
* Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
* PostScript (EPS/PS)
* OpenType/TrueType Fonts (OTF, TTF)
* XML Paper Specification (XPS)
* Archive Files (ZIP/RAR)

Similar to services like Scribd, Google Doc Embedder will allow you to embed these files directly into your page or post, not requiring
the user to have Microsoft Word, Adobe Reader, PowerPoint, or other software installed to view the contents. Unlike Scribd, the files do
not need to be uploaded to any service first - including Google Docs - but can exist anywhere publicly accessible on your site or the
internet.

Office XML (2007+) file formats are sometimes problematic with Google Viewer. Please test your documents, and when possible I recommend
you use the Office 2003 equivalent formats instead.

Note: Use of this plug-in implies your agreement with Google's published [Terms of Service](http://docs.google.com/viewer/TOS?hl=en "Terms of Service").

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `google-document-embedder` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Done.

Upload the documents to your site using the media upload facility built into WordPress, via FTP, or link to documents on another (public)
site. Use the Media Library or Google Doc Embedder button in the Visual editor to build the appropriate shortcode, or use the documentation.

For basic manual instructions, please see the FAQ. For advanced usage, see the [web site](http://www.davistribe.org/gde/usage/ "web site").

Go to "GDE Settings" (under "Settings" in the admin panel) to change defaults, or override individually using the shortcode syntax in the FAQ.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can the files live? =
The file to embed must first be publicly available somewhere on the internet, in order for Google to retrieve the document for conversion.
You can upload it to your WordPress site using the standard techniques, or link to a file on another site.

= How do I embed a file in my page or post? =
There are several ways you can insert a supported document, depending on your preference:

* Manually enter the shortcode (explained below).
* Upload a supported file type from a page or post, and from the Media Library, click the "Insert" button.
* Use the Google Doc Embedder button in the Visual editor to insert the `[gview]` shortcode.
* Paste the URL into the HTML editor, select it, and click the "GDE" quicktag button (HTML/Text editor).

To manually insert the `[gview]` shortcode into your page or post to embed the file, use the syntax below (use of the HTML tab in the editor
recommended):

`[gview file="http://url.to/file.pdf"]`

Note: the `file=` attribute (generally pointing to the full URL of the file) is **required**. If the majority of your files are referenced
from the same directory, you can set a File Base URL in GDE Settings and only put the changing portion in the `file=` attribute (or a full
URL for a file outside of that base URL). File Base URL will be prepended to the value of `file=` unless `file=` starts with `http` or `//`
(dynamic protocol selection).

Common optional attributes:

* `profile=` : Enter the number or name of the desired profile for the viewer to use (default profile is used if not specified)
* `width=` : To override the profile's default width of the viewer, enter a new width value - e.g., "400px" or "80%"
* `height=` : To override the profile's default height of the viewer, enter a new height value - e.g., "400px" or "80%"
* `page=` : Set to the number of the page you want the document to open up to (if not page 1)

For a list of all available attributes, see [Usage](http://www.davistribe.org/gde/usage/ "Usage").

= What are "Profiles"? =
Profiles allow you to create a unique batch of settings and access them from the viewer using only a profile ID (or name), rather than 
writing a horrifically complicated shortcode. This allows each instance of GDE (even on the same page) to be completely customizable while
keeping the shortcode syntax simple.

= Will it embed files that are password-protected or stored in protected folders/sites? =
Most likely, no. If your file requires a login to view - such as being saved in a password-protected directory, or behind a firewall
(on your intranet, etc.), the viewer will probably not be able to access the file. This is what is meant above, that the document should
be "publicly available." Please save the file in a publicly accessible location for best results.

= What about private documents? =
The file must be publically available, but there is no reason why you need to publish the location. With GDE you can hide the URL as well
as block direct downloads of the file. In combination with robots.txt and other mechanisms for blocking search engines or file browsing on
your site, the document can be effectively private to everyone but the viewer itself.

= Does it work with files saved in Google Docs/Drive? =
This plug-in utilizes the viewer from Google Docs in a standalone fashion. There is no direct integration with Google Docs and even those
documents stored there and shared publicly do not embed reliably with their standalone viewer (ironically), so at this time that use is not
supported by the plug-in. Please store your original documents somewhere on your web site in their native supported formats.

= Does it work in Multisite environments? =
Yes, though more granular multisite options are planned for future versions based on demand. If you use GDE in a multisite environment, I
welcome your feedback on helpful improvements.

= Other Common Questions =
More common questions are answered on the GDE web site [here](http://www.davistribe.org/gde/notes/ "Notes").
